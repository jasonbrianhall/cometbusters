# 🚀 COMET BUSTER: A Space Shooter for the Arcade Enthusiast

> *"The Destiny is no longer a mine. It is a crucible of war."*

Welcome to **Comet Buster**, the arcade-style space shooter that combines classic 2D action with cosmic horror and high-stakes survival. You pilot the **DESTINY**—an ancient warship of unknown origin, reborn as a mining vessel—through the Kepler-442 Asteroid Field while battling multiple hostile factions, mysterious sentinels, and colossal boss ships that defy comprehension. 

It's harder than it sounds. And significantly stranger.

---

## 🎮 The Quick Pitch

Imagine a classic space shooter—think *Asteroids*, *Galaga*, and *Space Invaders* in a blender—but with:
- **Six different enemy ship types** (Red Warships, Blue Patrols, Green Drones, Purple Sentinels, Cyan Brown Coats, and massive golden Juggernauts)
- **Multiple boss encounters** including colossal "engines of annihilation" and alien forces from the void
- **Wave-based progression** that gets exponentially harder
- **Resource management** (fuel, missiles, shields)
- **Score multipliers** that reward skill and punish carelessness
- **An actual narrative** about an ancient warship, fractured asteroids, and forces beyond comprehension
- **Joystick support** for authentic arcade gameplay
- **Audio integration** that syncs with the chaos

You're not just shooting things. You're piloting a mysterious ancient vessel, competing against multiple factions and enhanced variants for survival, and confronting threats that transcend simple combat.

## 📖 The Story (In a Not-So-Distant Future)

### The Kepler-442 Asteroid Field Crisis

The **Kepler-442 Asteroid Field** was once a stable mining zone—a treasure trove of rare minerals and exotic isotopes. Then something changed. Asteroids began fragmenting at unprecedented rates. Nobody knows why. Everyone has a theory.

Three major factions saw the chaos and saw opportunity. They sent ships. Then things got... complicated.

### Enter: The DESTINY

You pilot the **DESTINY**—an *ancient warship of unknown origin*. Its past is shrouded in mystery. Its manufacturer? Unknown. Its age? Nobody can say. All anyone knows is that it was *reborn* as a mining vessel, stripped of whatever weapons it once carried and refitted with mining equipment.

But those weapons? They're back. And they're ready.

The Destiny is fragile, yet fierce. It carries no banner, no allegiance—only the will to survive. It's the most independent ship in the field, which makes it either the bravest or the most foolish choice for a mission like this.

**You're about to find out which.**

### The Factions & Enemy Types

| Ship Type | Faction | Motivation | Behavior | Threat |
|-----------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **🔴 Red Warships** | Galactic Defense Collective | Military dominance | Hunt aggressively, ignore asteroids | ⚠️⚠️⚠️ |
| **🔵 Blue Patrols** | Independent Sector Alliance | Stabilize the region | Clear asteroids, patrol peacefully | ⚠️ |
| **🟢 Green Drones** | Asteroid Mining Collective | Extract resources | Strip-mine asteroids, territorial | ⚠️⚠️ |
| **🟣 Purple Sentinels** | Unknown | Unknown intent | Coordinate in formations, mysterious | ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ |
| **🔷 Cyan Brown Coats** | ISA Elite Division | Military support | Enhanced firepower, burst tactics | ⚠️⚠️ |
| **🟡 Juggernauts** | Unknown/Autonomous | Unknown | Chase relentlessly, fire missiles | ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ |

The first four are factions. The Cyan Brown Coats are elite variants of Blue ships. The Juggernauts are something else entirely—massive, autonomous, and terrifying. Spawn chances increase as waves progress, meaning you'll face harder and more varied opposition over time.

And that's just what *you know about*.

## 🚢 Detailed Faction & Enemy Profiles

### 🔴 RED WARSHIPS: The Military Hunter-Class Vessels (Type 1)

**Faction:** Galactic Defense Collective (GDC)  
**Threat Level:** ⚠️⚠️⚠️ HIGH  
**Spawn Chance:** 10-20% (increases with waves)

Red Ships are military enforcement—they hunt. They're here on behalf of the GDC to "maintain order," which really means secure military dominance. They shoot frequently (every 0.3-0.8 seconds), don't negotiate, and completely ignore asteroids. Their entire strategy is based on direct combat superiority.

**How to survive them:** Use your speed advantage. Evade in unpredictable patterns. Don't engage directly unless you have overwhelming firepower. Learn to use screen wrapping to escape pursuit.

---

### 🔵 BLUE PATROLS: The Peacekeeper Guard Craft (Type 0)

**Faction:** Independent Sector Alliance (ISA)  
**Threat Level:** ⚠️ LOW (Unless provoked)  
**Spawn Chance:** 70% → 40% (decreases with waves)

Blue Ships are actually trying to help. They clear asteroids methodically, follow peaceful patrol patterns with sine-wave oscillations, and only fire to destroy hazards. They won't attack you unless you hit them first—treat them as allies or at least neutral parties.

**Strategic note:** Blue Ships can serve as obstacles against Red Ship attacks. They're expendable in ways other ships aren't, and their deaths create explosions that can clear nearby asteroids.

---

### 🟢 GREEN DRONES: The Corporate Mining Interceptors (Type 2)

**Faction:** Asteroid Mining Collective (AMC)  
**Threat Level:** ⚠️⚠️ MODERATE  
**Spawn Chance:** 10% → 20% (increases with waves)

Green Ships are efficient corporate assets programmed to strip-mine asteroids faster than any other faction (0.15-0.4 second firing rate). They maintain a 300-pixel "restricted zone" around themselves. If you violate it, they will chase you with brutal force until you escape.

**The strategy:** Let Green Ships clear asteroids, then grab the fragments once you're safely out of range. They're competitive, not cooperative—use that against them.

---

### 🟣 PURPLE SENTINELS: The Enigmatic Guardians (Type 3)

**Faction:** Unknown / Unaffiliated  
**Threat Level:** ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ UNKNOWN  
**Spawn Chance:** 7% → 12% (increases with waves)  
**Formation:** Always spawns in pairs or trios

This is where things get unsettling.

Purple Sentinels didn't exist in the asteroid field until recently. They don't communicate. They don't follow conventional faction hierarchy. They **operate in synchronized formations** with eerie coordination. Their attack patterns are sophisticated—sometimes ignoring targets, sometimes coordinating focused fire on single objectives.

They maintain formation cohesion while moving and fighting. When one falls, others *react*—they communicate in ways the other factions don't. They hunt with intelligence rather than aggression.

Nobody knows *why* they're here. Theories include:
- Monitoring the asteroid field destabilization
- Investigating the ancient nature of the Destiny
- Gathering unknown samples or data
- Preparing for something much larger

**The danger:** They're not trying to kill you specifically. They're trying to accomplish *something*, and you might get caught in the crossfire when they do it.

---

### 🔷 BROWN COAT ELITE: The Enhanced Blue Guard (Type 4)

**Faction:** Independent Sector Alliance (Elite Division)  
**Threat Level:** ⚠️⚠️ MODERATE-HIGH  
**Spawn Chance:** 3% → 8% (increases with waves)  
**Color:** Bright Cyan (0.0, 0.9, 1.0)  
**Size:** 1.5x normal ship size

The Brown Coat Elite are... different. They're not regular Blue Patrols. These are hardened veterans—ships that appear to have combat experience. They're painted in a brilliant cyan that distinguishes them from regular Blue ships and fires with more tactical sophistication.

Brown Coats are faster and more aggressive than standard Blue Patrols, with enhanced firepower. They still clear asteroids but with more precision and intensity. They follow burst-fire attack patterns and respond to threats with tactical fire bursts rather than continuous streams.

**Danger level:** Higher than normal Blue ships, but not openly hostile like Red ships. Treat them with respect.

---

### 🟡 JUGGERNAUTS: The Massive Golden Destroyers (Type 5)

**Faction:** Unknown / Autonomous  
**Threat Level:** ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ EXTREME  
**Spawn Chance:** 10% at wave start (waves 2+)  
**Color:** Gold / Yellow  
**Size:** 3x normal ship size  
**Health:** 10 hit points  

*These are the real deal.*

Juggernauts are colossal golden warships that spawn occasionally at the beginning of waves (10% chance starting from wave 2). They are **MASSIVE**—three times the size of normal ships. They're slower than regular ships but implacable. Once they start hunting you, they *do not stop*.

**Behavior:**
- **Always chase the player** - No range limits, no mercy
- **Fire heat-seeking missiles** - Every 2.5-4.5 seconds, they launch tracking missiles aimed directly at you
- **Slow but relentless** - They're not fast, but they're persistent and impossible to outrun indefinitely
- **Multiple hit points** - Requires 10 hits to destroy (vs. 1 for normal ships)
- **Visible health bar** - Shows their remaining health in green → yellow → red

**Why they're terrifying:**
- Their missiles *track you* - you can't just fly straight
- They spawn with a 10% chance, meaning you might face 1-3 per wave
- The Star Vortex boss spawns entire *fleets* of Juggernauts in Phase 2
- One mistake against a Juggernaut means death

**Strategy against Juggernauts:**
1. Keep moving unpredictably
2. Maneuver sharply to avoid incoming missiles
3. Use boost thrusters to create distance
4. Focus fire from omnidirectional attacks if possible
5. Lead them into asteroid clusters for blocking
6. Kill them ASAP—missiles stack up fast if multiple are active
7. If facing multiple Juggernauts in Star Vortex, prioritize one at a time

### ⚫ COLOSSAL THREATS: Engines of Annihilation

Between waves lurk Boss Ships—massive capital-class vessels that rewrite the rules of combat:

- **The Death Star** - A rotating metallic sphere bristling with weapon ports. Fires in spread patterns and rotates continuously. Classic and straightforward by boss standards—dangerous, but predictable if you learn the patterns.

- **The Spawn Queen** - The recruiting nightmare. A floating matriarch that periodically spawns entire squadrons of enemy ships (6 Red, 2 Green, 2 Purple per spawn cycle). While dealing with the Queen, she also hurls massive asteroids at you. Control the spawning or drown in enemy waves.

- **The Void Nexus** - A fragmented entity that splits and multiplies. Spawns Brown Coat Elite ships as reinforcements. Defeat one fragment and it spawns smaller variants.

- **The Harbinger** - Rains devastating ordnance across the battlefield, creating no-go zones that expand and contract unpredictably.

- **The Star Vortex** - Warps local gravity, pulling asteroids into chaotic orbits. Spawns entire **Juggernaut fleets** in Phase 2. The ultimate chaos engine.

- **The Singularity** - The ultimate threat. Its existence barely makes sense. Few who've encountered it have lived to describe it.

When a Boss appears, you must abandon conventional tactics. Standard destruction doesn't work. These are puzzles to solve, not just enemies to shoot. Each boss demands understanding its attack patterns and exploiting its specific weaknesses.

### 👽 THE VOID: Signals from Beyond

The deepest fear isn't visible yet.

Reports from the outer edges suggest alien forces gathering—not from any known civilization. Descriptions are fragmentary: *"a tide," "consuming presence," "something that assimilates."*

Some theorists suggest the asteroid field fragmentation itself was a **warning**. That the asteroids were trying to tell someone something was coming.

You haven't seen them yet.

But they're out there.

And the fact that you're in this field at all might be exactly where they want you to be.

## 🎯 Game Mechanics Explained

### Your Arsenal

**Primary Cannons**
- Rapid-fire targeting system
- Click or use keyboard to shoot
- Unlimited ammo (because you're not a quitter)
- Fast bullet firing and shoots straight

**Boost Thrusters**
- 2.5x speed multiplier
- Limited fuel (energy bar)
- Burns fuel at 25 units/second
- Recharges at 10 units/second when idle
- Perfect for dodging or escaping

**Omnidirectional Fire**
- Middle-click for shots in all directions
- Emergency defensive option
- Can clear nearby asteroids in a pinch

**Missile System**
- **Dual Acquisition**: Get missiles two ways
  - **Pickups**: Destroy enemy ships for chance to drop missile pickups (+20 missiles each)
  - **Passive Generation**: When energy reaches 100 (full), missiles slowly load into the Destiny
- **Generation Rate (when energy = 100)**:
  - **Easy**: 5 missiles/second (max 200 missiles)
  - **Medium**: 2.5 missiles/second (max 100 missiles)
  - **Hard**: 1.25 missiles/second (max 25 missiles)
- **Auto-Toggle**: First missile acquisition automatically switches to missile mode
- **Manual Toggle**: Press Q to switch between bullets and missiles anytime
- **Usage**: Each missile fired costs 1 ammo
- **Strategic Note**: Best enemies to hunt for pickups are Red and Green ships; maintain full energy for consistent passive generation
- **Missile Aiming**: Multiple types of missiles are loaded.  Some aim for ships, some aim for the nearest comet, some aim for the furthest or the middlest.  Don't be surprised when your missile hits something you weren't aiming for.

### Survival Systems

**Lives System**
- Start with 3 lives (or more on easier difficulties)
- Each hit when shields are down costs a life
- Extra life earned every 100,000 points

**Shield System**
- Absorbs damage before lives are lost
- Regenerates slowly after 3 seconds of no damage
- Starts at 3 shield points (varies by difficulty)
- Visual impact indicator shows damage direction

**Invulnerability Frames**
- 2-3 seconds of protection after taking damage
- Flash to indicate active status
- Gives you time to escape and reorganize

### Scoring System

**Base Points**
- Small Comet: 50 points
- Medium Comet: 100 points
- Large Comet: 200 points
- Mega Comet: 500 points

**Score Multiplier**
- Starts at 1.0x
- Increases with hits
- Maximum of 5.0x multiplier
- **Resets to 1.0x when you take damage**
- Building multiplier is high-risk/high-reward
- Finishing a wave gives you points

**Life Milestones**
- Extra life every 100,000 points
- Encourages aggressive play while managing risk

### Wave Progression

Each wave gets exponentially harder:
- More asteroids spawn
- Asteroids move faster
- Spawn rates increase
- Enemy ships become more aggressive
- Between waves, enemies spawn a **Boss** that demands respect

## 🏆 Tips for Survival and Domination

### Understanding Each Ship Type

**Against Red Ships (The Relentless Hunters)**
- They *will* chase you
- They ignore asteroids—they're 100% focused on killing you
- Use your speed advantage
- Don't engage directly; evade and counter-attack
- Predictable patterns once you learn their rhythm

**With Blue Ships (The Helpful Peacekeepers)**
- They *want* to help by clearing asteroids
- Won't attack unless you hit them (don't be dumb)
- Use them as mobile obstacles against Red Ships
- Stay out of their way while they work
- Treat them as allies, not threats

**Against Green Ships (The Territorial Drones)**
- Incredibly aggressive within their 300-pixel "personal space"
- Shoots asteroids with scary efficiency (faster than you)
- Outside their range? Completely ignore you
- Strategy: Let them clear asteroids, then escape
- Getting cornered by Green Ships = bad time

**Against Purple Sentinels (The Coordinated Enigmas)**
- They spawn in pairs or trios
- Move with eerie synchronization
- More tactical than aggressive
- Their goal is unclear—stay out of the way when they operate
- Don't get caught between paired sentinels

**Against Cyan Brown Coats (The Elite Guards)**
- Stronger than regular Blue ships
- Use burst-fire attack patterns
- Faster and more aggressive
- Still follow patrol logic but with more intensity
- Watch for tactical regrouping behavior

**Against Juggernauts (The Golden Destroyers) - PRIORITY TARGET**
- **These are the most dangerous regular enemies**
- Spawn randomly at wave starts (10% chance from wave 2+)
- **Always chase you relentlessly—no range limit**
- Fire heat-seeking missiles every 2.5-4.5 seconds
- Require 10 hits to destroy (vs. 1 for normal ships)
- One Juggernaut can cascade into multiple missile threats
- **Survival Strategy:**
  1. When one spawns, immediately make it priority target
  2. Move unpredictably to dodge missiles
  3. Use boost thrusters for sharp evasive turns
  4. Lead them into asteroid clusters for blocking
  5. Kill them ASAP—delay = more missiles
  6. Star Vortex boss spawns entire Juggernaut *fleets* in Phase 2—devastating threat

### Resource Management

**Energy/Fuel Management**
- Energy recharges at 10 units/second when not boosting
- Boost burns energy at 25 units/second (2.5x speed multiplier)
- **Critical mechanic**: When energy reaches 100 (full), passive missile generation begins
- Don't constantly boost—you lose missile generation capacity
- Use short bursts to dodge, then let energy recover
- **High-Energy Play**: Maintain 80-100 energy to maximize passive missile loading
- **Low-Energy Play**: Drop below 50 energy for boost mobility when facing immediate threats
- Passive missile generation generates 1 missile every:
  - Easy: 0.2 seconds
  - Medium: 0.4 seconds
  - Hard: 0.8 seconds
- **Key trade-off**: Energy boosts mobility BUT full energy = missiles. Balance based on threat type

**Missiles (Dual Acquisition System)**
- **Direct Pickups**: Destroy enemy ships → chance to drop missile pickups (+20 missiles each)
  - Probability varies by difficulty (higher on easier difficulties)
  - Capped at 100-200 missiles depending on difficulty
- **Passive Generation**: When energy bar reaches 100 (full capacity), missiles slowly auto-load into the Destiny
  - Easy: 5 missiles/second (max 200 missiles)
  - Medium: 2.5 missiles/second (max 100 missiles)
  - Hard: 1.25 missiles/second (max 25 missiles)
- Missiles are more destructive than bullets but slower
- Better for large asteroids, Juggernauts, and boss fights
- **Dual Strategy**: Hunt enemy ships for pickups + maintain full energy for passive generation
- Missiles appear automatically in HUD when available
- Auto-toggles to missiles when you get first one; toggle anytime with Q key

**Shield/Invulnerability**
- Shields regenerate automatically (be patient)
- Don't take unnecessary risks while rebuilding shield
- Use invulnerability frames to reposition, not to be reckless

### Wave Strategy

**Early Waves (1-3)**
- Build your score multiplier aggressively
- Get comfortable with the game's rhythm
- Farm smaller asteroids for easy points
- Don't worry about efficiency

**Mid Waves (4-7)**
- Balance aggressive scoring with survival
- Learn enemy ship patterns
- Start managing resources carefully
- Boss waves introduce more complexity

**Late Waves (8+)**
- Pure survival becomes the priority
- Score multiplier is less important than lives
- Boss fights are the main event
- One mistake can cascade into game-over

**Boss Waves**
- Spawn every fifth wave
- Different boss every wave
- Bosses reset after 6 bosses (boss on wave 5 is the same as boss on wave 35)

### Energy & Missile Strategy

**The Core Systems**:
- **Energy**: Fuel for boost thrusters (recharges at 10/sec when idle, burns at 25/sec when boosting)
  1.  Pickups from destroyed enemy ships (10% chance; +1 shield)
- **Missiles**: Acquired two ways:
  1. Pickups from destroyed enemy ships (+20 per pickup)
  2. Passive generation when energy = 100 (rates vary by difficulty)

**The Critical Trade-off**: Energy management directly impacts both your mobility and missile generation. This is the key strategic tension:

**High Energy (80-100) Strategy**
- Missiles passively generate into your tank
- Less boost available for evasion
- Good for stationary defensive positions or dealing with clustered asteroids
- Missiles do more damage—useful against Juggernauts and bosses
- Slower movement = riskier in open space

**Low Energy (0-30) Strategy**
- Maximum boost capacity for aggressive evasion and pursuit
- No missile generation (must rely on enemy ship pickups)
- Good for dogfighting Red Ships or evading Juggernauts
- Sacrifice firepower (missiles) for mobility (boost)
- Higher risk but faster tactical options

**Balanced Energy (40-80) Strategy**
- Slow missile generation (not optimal)
- Moderate boost capacity
- Flexible for adapting to changing threats
- Recommended for mid-wave when threats are variable

**Acquisition Strategy**:
- **Hunt Red & Green Ships**: They're the most threatening; destroying them drops missile pickups
- **Farm Blue Ships**: Safe to hunt; destroying them also drops pickups
- **Avoid Juggernauts until low on missiles**: High risk for relatively low reward
- **Boss fights**: Pre-generate missiles to full capacity before engagement

**Wave-Specific Energy Management**:
- **Early waves (1-3)**: Keep energy moderate, focus on learning patterns and gathering pickups
- **Mid waves (4-7)**: Alternate between high energy for missiles and low for mobility based on emerging threats
- **Late waves (8+)**: Prioritize full energy for consistent missile flow when facing multiple Juggernauts
- **Boss fights**: Pre-load missiles to maximum before fight starts, then balance energy as needed during phases

### General Tactics

1. **Stay Centered** - Don't get pushed to the edges where escape is limited
2. **Manage Spacing** - Keep distance from clusters of asteroids
3. **Predict Movement** - Lead your shots; asteroids move in straight lines
4. **Use Screen Wrapping** - Exit one side to enter the opposite (great for escaping)
5. **Don't Panic** - Slow, deliberate movements are better than frantic mashing
6. **Track All Threats** - Monitor 6 enemy types: Red (aggressive), Blue (helpful), Green (territorial), Purple (coordinated), Cyan (elite), Juggernaut (relentless)
7. **Build Multipliers Smartly** - Only chase risky shots when shields are strong
8. **Watch for Spawn Escalation** - As waves progress, more dangerous ship types spawn with higher frequency
9. **Juggernaut Detection** - Identify Juggernauts immediately by their massive golden size and instant pursuit
10. **Remember: The Destiny is Ancient** - This ship survived something before. Trust its design, even when it seems fragile
11. **Prepare for Phase Shifts** - Boss fights have multiple phases. When patterns change dramatically, adapt your strategy

### Boss-Specific Strategies

**Against the Death Star**
- Relatively straightforward compared to other bosses
- Watch the rotating patterns—learn the timing of fire spreads
- Position yourself in the gaps between firing arcs
- Keep moving to avoid standing still when volleys arrive
- High shield and full missiles recommended before engagement

**Against the Spawn Queen**
- **THE PRIORITY THREAT** - This is arguably the most dangerous boss
- She doesn't shoot directly; instead she **recruits entire squadrons** (10 ships per wave: 6 Red, 2 Green, 2 Purple)
- While managing her recruitment waves, she also **hurls massive asteroids** at you
- Strategy:
  1. Focus fire on the Queen herself to reduce her health quickly
  2. Don't get distracted by the spawned ships—kill the Queen before she recruits again
  3. Expect chaos—you'll be juggling 10+ enemy ships, asteroids, and the Queen simultaneously
  4. Pre-generate missiles to maximum before fight starts
  5. Use omnidirectional fire to clear space around you when overwhelmed
  6. The Queen spawns from top-center, making her relatively stationary—exploit this
  7. Expect multiple recruitment phases—each one gets more intense

**Against the Void Nexus**
- Fragmented multi-part boss
- Destroying fragments doesn't kill it—they spawn smaller variants
- Focus on learning the fragmentation pattern
- Clear smaller fragments systematically
- Expect Brown Coat reinforcements

**Against the Harbinger**
- Ordnance-based threat—creates dangerous zones
- Pattern-heavy boss; learn the bombing patterns
- Stay mobile and predict where safe zones will be
- Don't camp in one location

**Against the Star Vortex**
- Two distinct phases
- Phase 1: Gravity manipulation with missile attacks
- Phase 2: Spawns Juggernaut fleets—expect 3-4 massive golden ships
- This is where you'll need maximum missile capacity
- Focus on Juggernauts in Phase 2; the Star Vortex becomes secondary threat

**Against the Singularity**
- The final boss; information is limited
- Prepare for the unexpected—this boss may break your assumptions
- Bring maximum firepower
- Trust the Destiny's ancient design

## 🛠️ Installation & Building

### Prerequisites

You'll need to compile this bad boy. Here's what you need:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev libcairo2-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev build-essential

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install gtk3-devel cairo-devel SDL2-devel SDL2_mixer-devel gcc gcc-c++ make

# macOS (with Homebrew) [completely untested]
brew install gtk+3 cairo sdl2 sdl2_mixer

# mingw on Fedora (adjust as needed)
sudo dnf install mingw64-gcc mingw64-gcc-c++ mingw64-gtk3 mingw64-gtkmm30 mingw64-SDL2 mingw64-SDL2_mixer
```

### Building

```bash
# Navigate to the game directory
cd cometbuster

# Compile for Linux
make

# Or compile for Windows (using MinGW)
make windows

# Run (Linux)
./build/linux/cometbuster

# Run (Windows with MinGW - after copying build directory to Windows)
cd build/windows 
(copy to windows all the DLLs and exe)
cometbuster.exe (on windows)

```

**Note on Windows builds**: To build for Windows, run `make windows` which uses MinGW. The executable is placed in `build/windows/cometbuster.exe`. When copying to a Windows machine, copy the entire `build/windows/` directory (not just the .exe) to ensure all dependencies are included.

### Audio Setup (Optional)

The game supports audio through a WAD file (ZIP archive) system:

```bash
# Create your WAD file with sounds and music
python3 createwad.py sounds/ music/ cometbuster.wad

# Place in the build output directory
# On Linux:
cp cometbuster.wad build/linux/

# On Windows:
cp cometbuster.wad build/windows/

# Run game
# Linux:
./build/linux/cometbuster

# Windows:
./build/windows/cometbuster.exe
```

If you don't have a WAD file, the game will still run in silent mode (it's actually fine for arcade purists).

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Game Won't Start
- Check that you have all dependencies installed
- Run with `./comet_buster --debug` for verbose output
- Make sure you're in the correct directory

### No Audio
- Ensure SDL2_mixer is installed
- Check that `cometbuster.wad` exists in the game directory
- Run without audio (it's still fun, I promise)

### Joystick Not Detected
- Ensure joystick is connected before launching
- Check that SDL2 joystick support is compiled in
- Try adjusting deadzone settings in options menu

### Performance Issues
- Disable particle effects
- Close other applications (game runs at locked 60 FPS)

### Weird Physics
- This is probably a feature, not a bug
- Physics are tweaked for arcade feel, not realism
- If something seems genuinely broken, check debug output

## 🎵 Audio Integration

The game uses a WAD (ZIP archive) system for audio:

### Creating Your WAD File

```bash
python3 createwad.py sounds/ music/ cometbuster.wad
```

### Expected Directory Structure

```
sounds/
  ├── fire.mp3
  ├── alien_fire.mp3
  ├── explosion.mp3
  ├── hit.mp3
  ├── boost.mp3
  ├── game_over.mp3
  ├── wave_complete.mp3
  └── missile.mp3

music/
  ├── track1.ogg
  ├── track2.ogg
  └── track3.ogg
```

The system supports WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC, and other formats (depends on SDL_mixer compilation).

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Custom Difficulty Settings

Modify `cometbuster_init.cpp` to create new difficulty presets:

```c
// Easy mode setup
initial_shield = 6;
initial_lives = 4;

// Hard mode setup
initial_shield = 1;
initial_lives = 3;
```

### Tweaking Game Balance

Look in the respective `_physics.cpp`, `_spawn.cpp`, and `_collision.cpp` files to adjust:
- Spawn rates
- Asteroid speeds
- Enemy behavior
- Damage values
- Boost multipliers

### Physics Tuning

The game balances arcade feel with reasonable physics. Key values:
- Ship max speed: configurable
- Rotation speed: snappy (15-20 degrees/frame)
- Boost multiplier: 2.5x feels right
- Asteroid breakup angles: randomized for variety

## 🎓 For Developers

### Adding New Enemy Types

1. Define new enemy struct in `cometbuster.h`
2. Implement spawn logic in `cometbuster_spawn.cpp`
3. Add update/AI logic in appropriate file
4. Add rendering in `cometbuster_render.cpp`
5. Wire into collision system

### Adding New Weapons

1. Create weapon struct
2. Update firing system in `cometbuster_physics.cpp`
3. Add ammo tracking to `CometBusterGame`
4. Implement rendering
5. Add input handling

### Custom Bosses

Boss logic is isolated in `cometbuster_boss.cpp`. See existing boss implementation for structure. Key requirements:
- Health system
- Movement AI
- Attack patterns
- Explosion effects on defeat

## 🚀 Into the Black

You've got everything you need. Or as much as anyone can have when piloting an ancient warship of unknown origin into a contested asteroid field where three major factions are fighting, enigmatic sentinels operate in coordinated silence, and something even darker gathers at the edge of everything.

Load up the Destiny. Fire up those thrusters. Dive into the Kepler-442 Asteroid Field.

The competition is fierce. The asteroids are deadly. The factions are motivated. The bosses are nightmarish. And something ancient sleeps in the void, waiting.

But the Destiny? The Destiny survived something before. Trust that design. Trust that ancient heritage.

May your aim be true, your fuel abundant, your shields strong, and your secrets safe.

**Welcome to Comet Buster.**

*"The Destiny remembers what you've forgotten. The question is: will you survive long enough to remember too?"*
